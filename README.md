Hey, my boy. I am testing with PyCharm and Github. Come and play with me!
with [A guide to Using Git in PyCharm](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2016/09/02/a-guide-to-using-git-in-pycharm-part-1/)
 
I am reviewing about...

 * Creating a local git repository
 * Adding and committing files
 * Making and committing changes to a python file
 
In Part 2
* Creating branches
* Merging branches
